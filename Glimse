Title: Airbnb Price Prediction in Italy

Overview: 
The project aims to provide more accurate rental price predictions for Airbnb 
listings in a specific location in Italy. This will not only add value to customers by 
ensuring they get a fair price for their rentals, but also benefit businesses by 
increasing transparency in how rental prices are determined. 

Business problem statement: 
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can 
accurately predict rental prices for Airbnb listings in a specific region. This will 
help customers get a fair price for their rentals and provide businesses with 
greater transparency in how rental prices are determined. 

Business Problem Understanding: 
The objective of the project is to develop a model that can help Airbnb customers 
get a fair price for their rentals and provide greater transparency to businesses 
on how rental prices are determined. By developing a machine learning model 
that can accurately predict rental prices, the project aims to add value to both 
customers and businesses. 

Approach: 
The approach to the project involves data collection, pre-processing, feature 
engineering, model selection and training, and model evaluation. By following 
this methodology, the project aims to develop an accurate machine learning 
model that can predict rental prices for Airbnb listings. 
We will evaluate the performance of our model using different metrics such as 
mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. We will compare 
the results of different algorithms and techniques to determine the most effective 
approach. 

Conclusions: 
In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict the price of an 
Airbnb hotel based on various features. This model will help Airbnb hosts to set 
an appropriate price for their listing and enable guests to make informed 
decisions about their accommodation. The project has the potential to provide 
valuable insights into the factors that drive Airbnb prices and improve the user 
experience for both hosts and guests.
